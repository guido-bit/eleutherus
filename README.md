Eleutherus, blockchain network protocol, cross chains.
Eleutherus is a blockchain-based communication protocol. With it we can build all the operations that today are applied with the blockchains known until now and include developments that until now have not been possible due to lack of technological capacity. Among many others, we see as the main development focus what we could call cross chains, that is, all applications based on blockchain working under the same communication protocol.
I invite you to read the white paper at www.eleutherus.info.
